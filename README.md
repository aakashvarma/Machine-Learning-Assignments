## Unsupervised Learning
The data has no target attribute

### Clustering
Clustering is a tehnique for finding similarity groups in a given data.
It groups data instances near to each other into one group and the data instances which are far into another groups.
Clustering is often called an unsupervised learning taskas no class values denoting an a priori grouping of the data instances are given, which is the case in supervised learning.
